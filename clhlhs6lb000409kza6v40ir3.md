## What is Open-Source?ü§î

***A source that is open to all!***

A project that is publicly accessible with its source code, open-source software allows developers to collaborate, share ideas, and modify existing functions. This fosters innovation and encourages a sense of community among developers.üöÄüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

Let me break üî™ down a little more.

Imagine you have developed a cool gaming application for the sake of a college project or anything can be the reason. Now one of your developer friends found a bug on it and they want to fix it and you are open to collaborate. Then?

Here the term **open-source** comes in. You just have to make your project available to everyone on platforms like **GitHub** and **GitLab**.

Many software is open source that you are using in your day-to-day life to which you can contribute. Example

1. **Twitter Algorithm**üê•
    
2. **Mozilla Mobile**‚ô®Ô∏è
    

%[https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm] 

%[https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios] 

and many more...

> **Note**: Pre-requisites to start with open-source are the basics of Git & Github.

## How to make your project open-source?üõ†Ô∏è

This depends upon our project scale level.

1. If you build a project for your personal use, you can simply push it on Github or Gitlab platforms.
    
    To do this, you must know the basics of the Git version control system and you are ready to go.
    
2. If you made a project that should be used by others then you must have these things:
    
    * An open-source license for your projects like **MIT** license, **Apache** license and **GNU** General Public license.
        
    * Publishing the source code in a public repository on **Github** or Gitlab.
        
    * Provide a clear and brief **README.md** file to make it easier for the contributors.
        
    * A proper **guideline** that you want to be followed by the contributorsüë©‚Äçüíªüìö
        
    * Apart from all these, keep your project **updated** by reviewing the pull requests or any issues created by others.
        

## How to find an open-source project for your tech stack?üîç

Finding a project which matches your skill can be overwhelming if you are a very beginner. I can feel you!ü•≤

In my opinion, there can be majorly two ways:

### Join the Communityüë•

To contribute to a project you must join their community. Joining the communities plays a vital role which helps you to get in touch directly with the maintainors and also break down the issue which you wish to work on.

You can find them on **Twitter**, **Discord**, and **Slack** social platforms.

Always **introduce** **yourself** by describing what you are learning and currently working on so that other folks can know and interact with you.

### Manually SearchüïµÔ∏è

Or you can directly search on the platforms like **GitHub**.

Now, type a **keyword** of your tech **stack**, also you can filter it by choosing languages you are familiar with.

I know, you're thinking "What next?"

After successfully hunting the project, you need to learn how to do an actual contribution. So let's jump into that.ü¶ò

## How to make your first contribution?üå±

Let's make your first contribution now! üí™

Yes, like right now!ü§Ø Follow the steps with me:

1. Open the EddieHub organization by clicking here üëâ[https://github.com/EddieHubCommunit](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity)y or directly go to the repository below.üëá
    
    %[https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/hacktoberfest-practice] 
    
    In this repo, we just have to add our name and **GitHub** **profile** URL to the list as a contribution.
    
2. Now it's very important to go through the **README.md** section and follow the guidelines in order to start contributing.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683813089591/b488c38f-702d-4f6c-99fa-4b54f3943d6a.png align="center")
    
3. The first thing to do is to **fork** the repository so that you can add your changes to the project.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683889442434/d24b4e25-bec9-432f-a2fc-4c33af649809.png align="center")
    
    By clicking on the `Fork` button will land you on this page.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683889689479/a602ff6a-c8c3-4173-8329-24b3a7847789.png align="center")
    
    In the **owner's** section select your user account. If you are not a member/owner of any other organization then it will automatically fill yours as it's doing above.
    
    Also, it will automatically give the repository name.
    
    Followed by this, click on the `Create Fork` button.
    
4. After that, the page will open up to the repository which we have just created.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683889957780/e4be6679-8e8a-477d-b023-6da314668771.png align="center")
    
    It will look like this. In this, we have now `user-name/repo-name` in the top left corner.
    
    The first thing you have to do now is to click on the `Synk fork` button to keep every change up to date.
    
5. From here we can do two things. First, is to **clone** the project by clicking on the `Code` button followed by the green color in your favorite editor and then perform changes.
    
    And the 2nd thing is to make changes directly on the **GitHub UI** which we will be doing in this learning. Although it is not recommended to do so for big projects, but this one is specifically made for demo purpose contribution so that anyone can learn easily.
    
6. Now on the left corner, there is a grey button called `main` which indicates that currently you are in the **main** **branch**. And for best practices, it is recommended to make changes always in a new branch.
    
7. So on the drop-down section give the name of the branch as per your choice, basically depends on what changes you're doing so we will give here `nameAdd` as the **new branch** name. And then click on the `Create branch: nameAdd`.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683896422301/e5c5998f-f73b-4259-a0f6-e5407bc00ee7.png align="center")
    
8. The page will look like this in which you are seeing your newly created branch. Now click on the `README.md` file to proceed further.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683896669312/a4d03a52-c3e7-49fe-83e9-7a173e6772ea.png align="center")
    
9. Now click on that **pencil icon** to start editing the file and make sure you are on the `nameAdd` branch
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683896998484/d4f9981b-446f-4e08-9bc6-66e897c64933.png align="center")
    
10. Now **add** your **name** to the list according to the naming convention and add your GitHub **profile** URL.
    
    If you are not sure about the URL then copy-paste the above URL of any till [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and after that check your username above at the left corner and put that onwards.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683897438747/f3f2a5aa-c97d-4d91-8c7c-fefb83174e13.png align="center")
    
11. Now click on the `Commit changes` button but before doing that re-check your changes.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683897695667/5c6714ba-8f56-4c45-93b8-450c1d5e324b.png align="center")
    
    Check the commit message and the branch and click again on the `Commit changes` button.
    
12. Now the **pull request** page opens up automatically but sometimes it doesn't appear rarely. So go to the pull requests section and click on the `New pull request` button.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683898106816/4bd80293-0468-4283-b057-e8a5445c5722.png align="center")
    
13. If by default it is showing the `main` branch then change it to the branch where we have made our changes.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683898182821/4c220e80-4a98-4f63-8398-769c8abab982.png align="center")
    
14. Now check carefully the branches starting with the `base repository` to the `base: main` branch where the changes going to be reflected going towards the `head repository` which is ours in this case followed by the `branch` we made.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683898418038/993ccf5e-5190-4352-ad1d-118c6c0ff9e4.png align="center")
    
15. You can also see your changes once again so that you can re-check them by scrolling down.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683898515135/45add365-8a80-4591-b847-b9af83bc8292.png align="center")
    
16. Now it's time to click on the `Create pull request` button. On clicking that this page opens up, again click on the `Create pull request` button.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683898653696/6c734ccf-ef85-4d78-8e9c-7df1c1360604.png align="center")
    
17. And that's it. You can add a **comment** of your choice or just remove those lines into the comment block.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683898781881/34e395cd-9817-4a2d-bde8-62bbc3767c5a.png align="center")
