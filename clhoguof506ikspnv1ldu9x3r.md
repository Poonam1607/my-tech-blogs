I know many of you are judging me for the subtitleüòÖ because you didn't get it. Don't worry you'll get it after reading this blog.

And "*if you know, you know!*"üòâ Anyways, in this blog, I will be sharing my whole experience of writing blogs on **Hashnode** with and without a **pro** subscription and will give an **honest** review.

*(P.S: Listen with the audio feature to save time*üôÇ)

## Hashnodeüíô

Lol! You know where you are right now. Yes, reading my blog on Hashnode. So, If you're a Hashnode user then skip this section and move forward. This section is intended for my friends who may not be familiar with Hashnode and are only here to support me.

So basically **Hashnode** is a platform where anyone can share anything. You can share your knowledge/experiences/feelings in the form of words.

Mainly it is a community of writers who are tech enthusiasts where they share their knowledge and one can learn according to their choice of stack.

You can also say,

> ***It is a blogging platform for developers and tech enthusiasts***.

## Features they offer in a free subscriptionüé∫

It can be two aspects of the features to use Hashnode. Let's see what are they.

### Writer's perspective‚úçÔ∏è

* **Auto saving mode** - It's a common but crucial feature for writers that allows them to focus on their work without the worry of losing progress in case they forget to manually save their work, as this AI-enabled feature automatically saves their work.
    
* **Revision History** - This is a fantastic feature that enables you to return to any point in time since you began writing, allowing you to recover any changes you may have discarded and wish to revisit.
    
* **GitHub** - If you are an open-source enthusiast, then this feature is perfect for you. It automatically backs up all your blog posts and stores them on GitHub. All you need to do is connect your GitHub account with Hashnode.
    
* **Publish on a back-date (Time Travelling)** - On Hashnode, you have the ability to publish an article with a back-date, which is like time-traveling to a past date. This is a useful feature when you're on a tight deadline and need to meet a publishing schedule."
    
* **Custom Domains** - If you see my blogging URL looks like this [`myblog.hashnode.dev`](http://yourblog.hashnode.dev) by default but you can upgrade your domain by giving the **domain** name of your **personal** choice to make it more professional which can help you to build your brand.
    
    [`yourblog.hashnode.dev`](http://yourblog.hashnode.dev) , to [`blog.your-domain.com`](http://blog.your-domain.com)`.`
    

### Reader's perspectiveüëÄ

* Based on your reading preferences, Hashnode **recommends** blogs and articles that are similar in nature.
    
* **RSS Feed** - It provides an RSS feed for the readers to stay updated with thier liking blogs and articles
    
* **Newsletter** - It offers the feature of newsletter subscriptions, which allows readers to subscribe to both Hashnode's official newsletter and their favorite blogger's newsletter to receive updates on their latest posts.
    
    And in case you are enjoying reading my blogs, please don't forget to subscribe to my newsletter as well.

* You should know that you can like a blog up to 10 times in a row. I'm just letting you know in case you'd like to show your appreciation for this blogü´£üòÖ.
    

### My Experienceüß¢

I usually write blogs once or twice a month. However, last month I surprisingly managed to write 10 in a rowü•µ. Don't forget to check them outü•π.

So as a consistent writer on this platform, I must say that my experience has been amazing so far. The built-in **Grammarly** suggestions have been incredibly helpful to me. If I misspelled something then I don't even bother to correct it myself because Grammarly does its job perfectlyü´°.

The next thing I want to mention is whenever I write, I find myself deleting and rewriting phrases multiple times. However, when I'm done writing and previewing my work, I often end up preferring the previous version. That's why the revision history featureüîÑ is the one I use frequently while working on blogs.

### Rix: A Treasure Trove of Knowledgeüí†

(ps: also, the above title is AI generatedü§ì)

* Rix, the **AI chatbot** on the Hashnode platform, is an incredible resource for answering a wide array of general queries.
    
* Its remarkable ability to provide insights across numerous fields is truly commendable.
    
* The diverse code samples it offers in various **programming languages** make it an invaluable tool for enthusiasts and professionals alike.
    
* The absolute **BEST** part that sets it apart from other chatbots is its unbeatable **accessibility**! Ever ready to assist you with your burning questions at any given moment.
    
* If you're a regular **ChatGPT** user, you'll totally get what I'm saying. Like, when you keep asking a bunch of questions one after another in GPT, it sometimes **stops** giving answers and tells you to chill for a bit before asking again.
    

## Hashnode Proüíù

Everything was going great until I came across the introduction to **Hashnode 2.0** ie **Hashnode's Pro** version. I usually don't purchase the pro subscriptions of any unless they have some mind-blasting features to serve.

I had been hearing a lot about the new **AI features** that come in the **Pro package**. But how do I believe without trying it onceü§î? So I drop the idea of purchasing it. But then, I discovered that they are offering **free trials** which made me reconsider.

The best thing which I genuinely appreciate is they are giving a free trial **without** taking any of my **credentials**. Because generally, any free trial requires your credentials then they will auto-detect the money from your account if you don't cancel it manually.

Ok, I talked a lot! But trust me I don'tüò∂. Moving forward,

### What they are serving?üßë‚Äçüç≥

1. **Advance Customization** - With the pro subscription you can take your blogging appearance to another level beyond the **standard version**. You can beautifully personalize the design, CSS, and JS, templates to make your blog more captivating and distinct. This level of customization helps set your blog apart from the rest and makes it feel uniquely yours.
    
2. **Advanced Analytics** - You can keep an eye on the details of **traffic** coming, page **views**, bounce **rates** and many more which helps you to speed up your blogging game and grow your audience accordingly.
    
3. **Custom Logos** - You can customize your blog's logo for branding and make it more unique from others which will give a distinct identity to your blog.
    

And many more, which I will be covering in my experience part. Moving forward to it.

### My Experience with Hashnode 2.0üé©

As you are aware, **I** have recently **signed** up for the **free** 3-day trial of Hashnode **Pro** subscription, and during that time, I decided to write a blog post to experience the full potential of the Pro version and showcase some of the features that it offers in my blog post, to help you guys to decide whether it is worth buying or not.

This is the [blog](https://poonam1607.hashnode.dev/open-source-a-gem) I am talking about that I have written. Let's see what features I used and how they helped me to write even better.

1. I always consider adding an engaging **subtitle** to my blog posts, but I often struggle to do so. Fortunately, there is a feature where the AI suggests captivating titles and subtitles. The subtitle you see in my latest article was generated using this remarkable tool. Seeüëá

2. There is a feature called **Improve my intro** paragraph which is again an amazing thing to improvise your beginning.
    
3. If you noticed, I barely include conclusions in my blogs which is not a reader-friendly thing to do. I struggle a lot, to sum up my blogging topic. With the added feature, I easily summarized my blog and came up with a conclusion in my previous blog. Click on the imageüëá

4. * I usually **promote** my blog posts exclusively on my [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/pawartwt), as it's the only social platform that I'm currently active on.
        
    * However, I typically rely on a simple message like "My new blog post is up, check it out" to reach my audience.
        
    * Recently, while exploring the pro version features, I stumbled upon a powerful feature: Hashnode AI generating Twitter threads.
        
    * This **AI tool** automatically generates a **Twitter thread** based on my blog's topic, which is a remarkable feature that can really help to maximize visibility and promote engagement.
        
    
    Check out the Twitter thread here:

### Other Cool Featuresüëì

There are still soo many features that the pro version offers you. Have a looküëÄ

## Conclusion‚õ≥

Overall, the platform is an excellent choice for tech enthusiasts and developers looking to share their knowledge and grow their online presence. The Pro version enhances the experience even further with advanced customization, analytics, and AI tools that help improve writing and promote content effectively

If you ask me whether to recommend purchasing this or not, I would say:

If you prefer a simple, **black-and-white**‚ö´ style blog, then you don't need to upgrade. However, if you desire a **vibrant**, **colorful**üü° blog, then you must!

By black and white, I mean if you're using this platform solely for personal **practice** or self-learning, then you don't need to purchase the subscription. But if you're here to **elevate** your writing skills and **expand** your **online** **presence**, then it's definitely worth buying.

So coming up with my main subtitle, now you got my pointü´£.

> Pehle istemaal kare Phir vishwaas kare!

(translation)

Don't blindly follow random advice. First, try it out, and then believe it!
