### Introduction

Cloud-native applications are becoming highly popular because of their flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, it becomes a very tedious task to deploy and manage these applications.

Let me give you a glimpse of how cloud-native apps deploy and manage *traditionally*\-

1. ***We have to manually configure the servers required in our app setup:***  
    This involves setting up servers, installing dependencies, and deploying the application. This also includes configuring IP addresses, ports and database connections.

2. ***Manual Scripting:***
    
    Developers have to write all the scripts and large yaml files to install dependencies, including replicas, service ports, and environment variables which require a great skillset and deep understanding of the language.
    
3. ***Scaling, Managing, Networking*** and many more components are there which are done manually by developers.
    

Here OAM finally comes into the picture as a savior for the developers

### Open Application Model OAM

Let me explain to you in the simplest way I can.

Just like how a resume template provides us with a standardized format and structure for a job applicant to present their skills and experience,  
*the OAM standard provides a standardized format and structure for developers to describe the components, configuration, and dependencies of a cloud-native application.*  
Got my point?

> OAM is designed to simplify the development and deployment of cloud-native applications by abstracting away the underlying infrastructure and providing a higher-level interface for defining application components, traits, and their relationships.

### How OAM is the best?

Now let's directly get into the **<mark>use cases</mark>** which save developer's life:)

1. OAM allows developers to focus on the business logic of their applications, rather than the underlying infrastructure and doing the time-consuming stuff manually.
    
2. Higher-level abstraction: OAM provides a **higher-level** **abstraction** than tools like Kubernetes Deployment API or Helm.
    
3. It allows developers to define **components** and **traits**, which represent the application logic, separately from the infrastructure details. This makes it easier to maintain and **update** the application.
    
4. OAM provides you with facilities for application **scaling**, **versioning**, **monitoring**, and **debugging**, which makes it easy for you to manage your application.
    
5. With OAM, you can **avoid** **vendor** **lock-in** because it is an open standard that works with multiple cloud providers.
    
6. If you have an application that you want to **deploy** on one cloud provider and later want to deploy it on another provider, OAM can help you with that.
    
7. To **customize** applications in Kubernetes, developers need to create custom YAML files, which is an advanced level skill.  
    However, with OAM, developers can define components and traits for their applications more simply and intuitively, without needing to **create** **custom** **YAML** files.
    

*If you want to understand id through the* ***<mark>example</mark>****:*

Let's say you are a developer and you need to deploy a cloud-native application. If you use traditional methods, you will need to configure infrastructure details such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and security. This involves dealing with a lot of complexities and requires investing more time and resources.

However, with OAM, you can define your application's components and traits, and easily deploy your application using OAM templates.  
You don't need to manage infrastructure details because OAM automates them.  
This way, you get more flexibility for your application development and deployment, and you can focus more on your business's core features and functionality.

### Cloud-Native Platform

Now, to apply these OAM Standards, you need a cloud-native platform.  
***<mark>NAPPTIVE</mark>*** is a cloud-native application management platform.

Using the principles of OAM, developers can customize their applications and deploy and manage them using Napptive.

### How to get started with Napptive?

1. Go to their amazing website [https://napptive.com/](https://napptive.com/)
    
2. Sign-up for free (if developer) or you can go with the pro version as per your need.
    
3. Go to their documentation site. They have everything you want to know  
    [https://docs.napptive.com/](https://docs.napptive.com/)
    
4. Join the Slack community channel
    

And that's it:) GoüöÄ play aroundü§ñ and deployüê≥ your applicationüõ∏.

### Should Napptive be your first choice?

Let's talk about the **<mark>features</mark>** which they are serving on our plate!

1. They have an amazing playground for developers like us in which we can deploy our application in just a few steps.
    
2. In the playground section, it has a drag-and-drop user interface, which allows you to easily build, configure, and deploy cloud-native application components.
    
    ![[resize output image]](https://im3.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-3-3f586734a9.gif align="center")
    
    This feature is not available in other cloud-native platforms which is so cool and handy to use. I personally like it;)
    
3. If you are a working professional then before buying you can book a free demo to get a glimpse and clarification of all your stuff.
    
4. Using the principles of OAM, developers can customize their applications and deploy and manage them using Napptive.
    
5. It can seamlessly integrate with any cloud provider or container orchestration system, such as Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Docker, etc.
    
6. They have pre-built templates and components available, which make the application deployment process even simpler.
    
7. With the help of Napptive's auto-scaling feature, applications can be automatically scaled, ensuring that their performance is maintained even during high-traffic situations.
    

Overall, Napptive is a very powerful and easy-to-use cloud platform that allows you to easily deploy scalable and high-performance applications.  
It can be a great choice for enterprises looking to modernize their applications and take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing.
