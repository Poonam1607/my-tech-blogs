You might read a lot of success stories of the folks, what they achieved, and how they made their best out of the year 22🤯. My story is quite different. Actually, it's been a very dejected or I can say regretful year of mine. I know it sounds very unpleasant and demotivating😶‍🌫️ but that's the harsh truth of my 22 journey.

Let me introduce myself So that you can get a much better context of my story.

## Journey Begins

I'm a 22 Grad in Computer Science Engineering💻 currently with no job and no internships done yet🤕. No, actually I did an internship as a UI developer just to explore my interests in it but it didn't work for me.

I literally "only" search for roadmap🗾 days and nights to get started for a job ready or with something I might like to do and it's funny that I didn't leave a single video of a roadmap on youtube and ended up doing nothing with that information.

So my year started with learning development.

I first tried Android Development📱 from a well-known ed-tech company. This course is of around 3 months.

From that learning, I build a "Food Runner"🍱 app that allows users to signup for the app than a page opens up that gives them a list📑 of restaurants to order food from wherever they want.

That is obviously an incomplete app. I didn't make up that application due to a lot of bugs and errors🗳 which I didn't resolve and dropped in the middle. There were no sessions of doubt-clearing. I am not putting the full blame on that platform, somewhere it's my mistake that I didn't put in the efforts that it demands.

As I was in my final semester so some unnecessary assignments and tests were also heading at that time.

I made a project which captures the images of students present in the classroom and takes attendance in an excel sheet and marks present/absent📝 referring to the database information in my final year.

To be honest, I googled some projects and picked the easier one and understood the whole algorithms and source code of it and just copy pasted it without doing any modifications.

My presentation went quite well because it was online and it's from my experience I had my worst learning experience in college due to online classes. I learned nothing from college during those two years of my life.

**My 2.5 years of college life went just like that. I spent the whole 2 years at home due to COVID😷 and this covid made my college life worst. Nevermind,**

So I did the paperwork too for the sake of the college event called the 7th International Conference "Shaastrath-2022". We are four of them on my team. My research topic is an ATTENDANCE SYSTEM USING FACE RECOGNITION AND DETECTION.

Basically, it is a research on machine learning-based project of different methods made on attendance systems till today. Ya! You guessed it right. It's the same topic🥴 I did my major project.

The only best thing that happened to me was I found @[Kunal Kushwaha](@kunalk)'s [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/kunalkushwaha)🔥. Then I started learning Java + Data Structures but had to leave that also because of the end sem examination.

Then the End-Semester exams came and I became a B.E graduate👨‍🎓.

I want to do all things collectively so after the exams I also learned front-end development and as usual, dropped it in middle due to a lack of interest. Then finally, I came to know about the DevOps🤩 field.

First I started learning from Kunal's channel then I purchased the full course of DevOps from the KodeKloud platform and now I'm learning DevOps.

I started this course in November. And till now I have learned

* Git for Beginners🤠
    
* Linux Basics👨‍💻
    
* Shell Scripts for Beginner👾
    
* Docker Beginner Course🐬
    
* Golang🏃‍♂️
    
* Jenkins🥸
    
* Kubernetes Beginner Course🕸
    
* Ansible for an absolute beginner course
    

And now I'm learning Terraform Basics.

These all courses are in DevOps Beginner Level Course.

The reason I purchase the course is that while learning from youtube I got stuck every couple of minutes. A lot of questions arises that I couldn't clear on my own. This platform has great learning and applying exercises simultaneously.

They have amazing labs and provide real hands-on lab🙌 experience on which we can do all things like creating clusters and deploying the applications without installing or doing any setup in our system which was a big chaos to do.

I am not promoting anybody, just sharing the experience that I learned so far.

## Lessons

I know my story is not inspiring for sure. But I can surely say that the mistakes I did you can definitely avoid them before you start something.

The biggest lesson I learned so far is that

> ***There's nothing like the correct or the best kind of "roadmap" that exists.***

1. **Stop searching for roadmaps.** If you want to start with something or anything, just start it today or maybe right now \[but after reading my journey🙃\].
    
    And how can you do that?
    
    Connect🕵 with all the amazing folks out there in your interested fields, they are here to help us, and the community is very helpful. Take guidance from them✅.
    
2. **Don't jump directly to the paid courses🤑.**
    
    The mistake I did that not to go with the amazing free resources available out there and purchased the course directly, which I dropped in the middle due to the deluge of doubts which as a result piqued my interest.
    
    First search for free online resources. I know there are hundreds of courses which makes it difficult to choose the best one.
    
    You can refer to this GitHub:
    
    %[https://github.com/WeMakeDevs/roadmaps] 
    
    Here, you can find one of the best free resources in almost every tech field. They are adding more...
    
3. ***Learn and Apply🏳***
    
    Whatever you are learning just apply that somewhere by building basic projects or even you can start your ***open-source*** journey by contributing what you've learned so far.
    
4. ***Learn in public📣***
    
    What does it mean?
    
    * Whatever you are learning now, just share it on your socials so that your mates and other folks who belong to that field get to know about your learnings and your journey.
        
        This will help you to grow and you might get internships or even job just by connecting to the people.
        
    * You can also do this by writing blogs. Whatever you've learned, write a blog⌨️ on that topic.
        
        This will sharpen your learning, your writing skills, your thinking capability, and many more and by doing this you're giving the community back.
        
        Just try it out. This will help you in many ways.
        
        *I too started writing blogs last month. You can check out my first-ever blog here:* [GraphTraversal](https://poonam1607.hashnode.dev/graph-traversal)📊
        
5. ***Connect to people🤝***
    
    I have always been I kid who never talks to anyone in the classroom.
    
    I am the biggest introverted kind of kid who hesitates to speak to anyone. This is one of the main reasons I lagged in my life📈. Due to this fear, I literally didn't know anyone apart from my college mates.
    
    Don't do this kind of mistake.
    
    *Connect to people, share your learnings, and exchange your thoughts. Just go and talk, connect.*
    

## 2023 Goals

* To complete this course on DevOps.
    
* To give the community back by contributing to open-source.
    
* Connect to the amazing folks out there.
    
* Start attending confernces.
    
* Write blogs once or twice a month.
    
* Land a Remote Job in the DevOps field🔥🥸.
