First flight?‚úàÔ∏èI mean new to cloud computing?üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è

No worries!üòâI got you:)

After reading this blog you will definitely gain some cloud computing fundamentals.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software and analytics, over the Internet, on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Essentially, cloud computing allows users to access these computing resources remotely, without having to build or maintain their own infrastructure.

*This is what AI says about cc*. `(alias: cloud computing ~ cc)`

Let's understand cc more simply,

CC is like renting a houseüè° instead of buying one.

Just like how you don't need to worry about the maintenance of the house when you rent it, in cc you don't need to worry about the maintenance of the physical server or the infrastructure.

Instead, you can rent a virtualüèïÔ∏è space on the internet where you can store your data and run your applications. This virtual space is called the Cloud.‚òÅÔ∏è

In the DevOps world, cc is important because it allows the teamü§ñ to quickly and easily deploy and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

With cc, developers can easily provision the required resources and test their applications, and operation teams can easily monitorüïµÔ∏è and manage the applications in production.

## Why cloud-computing is important in DevOps?

* CC is a key enabler of the continuous delivery and deployment of applications.
    
* Cloud platforms offer a variety of services, including Infrastructure as a Service (***IaaS***), Platform as a Service (***PaaS***), and Software as a Service (***SaaS***), which can be leveraged to *build*, *test,* and *deploy* applications.
    
* The cloud provides a flexible and scalable infrastructure that can be rapidly provisioned and de-provisioned to meet the demands of modern application development and deployment.
    

## What are some common use cases?

1. **Application** **hosting**: Cloud platforms offer a range of services that can be used to host web applications, mobile applications, and APIs. These services can be scaled up or down based on demand, allowing companies to handle traffic spikes without overprovisioning their infrastructure.
    
2. **Continuous integration and delivery**: Cloud platforms provide tools and services that enable teams to build, test, and deploy applications in a continuous and automated fashion.
    
3. **DevOps toolchain**: Cloud platforms offer a range of tools and services that can be used to manage the entire DevOps toolchain, from version control to monitoring and alerting.
    
4. **Disaster Recovery & Backup**: Cloud platforms can be used to store backups and replicate data to provide redundancy in case of a disaster.
    

## How can you choose a cloud platform?

To start deploying applications on the cloud, you first need to choose a cloud provider.

Some popular options are:

Amazon Web Services (**AWS**),

Microsoft Azure, and

Google Cloud Platform (**GCP**)

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680960477299/ae369cc2-b326-43de-b329-e018bbb2bd6c.png align="left")

Each provider offers their own set of services, so it's important to do some research to find the one that best fits your needs.

Some following factors you can keep in your mind while choosing the one:-

1. üí∏**Cost**: Different cloud platforms have different pricing models, and it is important to choose a platform that fits your budget.
    
2. üì°**Services**: Different cloud platforms offer different services, and it is important to choose a platform that offers the services you need.
    
3. ‚öôÔ∏è**Integration**: It is important to choose a cloud platform that integrates well with your existing tools and infrastructure.
    
4. üìà**Scalability**: It is important to choose a cloud platform that can scale up or down based on demand.
    

You can start it for free as well for practicing purposes.

All AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, Heroku, Digital Ocean etc offers a free trial that allows you to access some of their popular services for a limited time period.

Once you've chosen a cloud platform, you can deploy your applications to it by creating virtual machines or using containerization technologies like Docker.

With cloud computing, you can easily scale your applications up or down as needed, and you only pay for the resources you use.

## How to use a cloud platform?

* **Creating a virtual machine or container**: This involves creating a virtual machine or container that will host your application.
    
* **Configuring the virtual machine or container**: This involves configuring the virtual machine or container to run your application, including installing dependencies and configuring environment variables.
    
* **Deploying the application**: This involves copying the application files to the virtual machine or container and starting the application.
    

## Projects & Resources

*The best way to learn something is by reading their official documentation page.*

* **Cloud service provider documentation**: Cloud service providers like [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_ql_doc_do), [Microsoft Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?wt.mc_id=rmskilling_docs_onboarding_inproduct_gdc&product=popular), and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/free?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=japac-IN-all-en-dr-BKWS-all-cloud-trial-EXA-dr-1605216&utm_content=text-ad-none-none-DEV_c-CRE_634320416318-ADGP_Hybrid%20%7C%20BKWS%20-%20EXA%20%7C%20Txt%20~%20GCP_General_gcp_misc-KWID_43700074200797688-aud-1644542956068%3Akwd-316837059054&userloc_9300152-network_g&utm_term=KW_gcp%20documentation&gclid=Cj0KCQjwocShBhCOARIsAFVYq0jxcuxUJHnQNhVfQlPjRW5LjnfVjE7hpYb80HqeqmJOqzr7VWuy52oaAp_FEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) offer extensive documentation on their platforms, including tutorials and guides.
