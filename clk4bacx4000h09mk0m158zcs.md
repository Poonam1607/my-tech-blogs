## Introduction👼

We all know Avengers!🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️ (If don't then no worry, it's a group of superheroes come together to save the world🌏 from chaos having different superpowers👊 with them)

DevOps is not a person or any single authority one can become. It's a culture or methodology or I can say it is the Avengers where there are many tools and techniques used to perform crucial things between development and operations.

Just like the Avengers feature iconic characters such as Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and many more.🛡️

DevOps incorporates essential components like Linux, scripting, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Grafana, and many others.🔁

Each of these tools plays a crucial role, leveraging its specific strengths within the DevOps landscape.

Now let's look from a technical perspective.

## What is DevOps?♾️

Different definitions (*over the internet*) -

> DevOps is a methodology that involves practices to bridge the gap between Dev and Ops teams by using Open source automation build tools.

> DevOps is the union of people, processes, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users."

Let's dive into this and make this easier.

Imagine you and your team have developed a web application that is now ready to go live. However, there are multiple steps and procedures involved in delivering the application to end users. This is where DevOps comes into play, making the entire process smoother and more reliable.

What do I mean by "smoother"?

* It means automating every process and enabling scalability according to the demand.
    
* It means having systems that automatically scale up or down based on user traffic, ensuring optimal performance.
    
* It means having mechanisms in place to auto-heal if any failures or crashes occur, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous availability.
    
* It means taking care of all the necessary tasks and processes that come into play once the application is live.
    

DevOps practices help achieve all of this.

They provide the tools, methodologies, and cultural mindset needed to streamline and automate the development, deployment, and maintenance of the application.

With DevOps, you can automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying the application, eliminating manual effort and reducing the chances of human error.

By leveraging infrastructure-as-code and containerization technologies, you can easily provision and manage the necessary resources, allowing for seamless scalability.

Once the application is live, DevOps ensures continuous monitoring and observability.

It enables you to collect and analyze metrics, logs, and user feedback to gain insights into the application's performance and identify areas for improvement.

I know, there are so many words that confused you. Let's break down all of them.

## Basic Terminologies🥸

1. **Automation** -
    
    * With Automation, DevOps teams can ensure consistent and reliable deployments.
        
    * They can create clever scripts and use powerful tools to streamline the process and eliminate those tedious, error-prone manual steps.
        
    * It's like having a secret weapon that guarantees smooth and efficient software releases every time.
        
    * Example Jenkins.
        
2. **Scaling** -
    
    * Scaling is like giving your application a growth spurt, making it capable of handling increased workloads and a growing fanbase.
        
    * It's like upgrading your application's powers to handle more traffic and keep the performance top-notch.
        
    * You can make your application availability up and down as per the requirements.
        
    * Example Kubernetes and Docker Swarm.
        
3. **Infrastructure** -
    
    * Infrastructure provides a stable and reliable environment for deploying your application.
        
    * It ensures that your application has the necessary resources, such as servers, databases, and networks, to run efficiently and handle user traffic.
        
    * It enables scalability, automation, resource management, security, and collaboration, ultimately helping developers deliver high-quality software while optimizing performance and costs.
        

## Why DevOps is Important?💭

* One of the main reasons why it's important is because it allows for faster and more efficient software delivery.
    
* By breaking down silos between development and operations teams, DevOps enables organizations to release software updates and new features at a much quicker pace, keeping up with the demands of today's fast-paced market.
    
* Another important factor driving the adoption of DevOps is the need for increased collaboration and communication between teams.
    
* DevOps fosters collaboration between developers and operations personnel throughout the entire software development lifecycle, resulting in improved software quality and a culture of innovation and continuous improvement within the organization.
    
* The development team uses version control systems like Git to manage code changes. They adopt continuous integration practices, where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository. Automated tests are executed to ensure code quality.
    

As we saw the DevOps as the Avengers above, we will be discussing all the individuals seperately in the upcoming articles. Because attempting to condense the rich history, capabilities, and strengths of these Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow in this will be next to impossible.🙂

So it's the same with DevOps tools. We will be learning Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform and many more individually.🤓
